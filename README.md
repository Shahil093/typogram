Typogram (short for typographic programs) is a programming language that only operates with typographic derivations. It is intended to be used to represent and verify derivations in axiomatic systems (e.g. mathematical derivations). 

Typogram borrows from [metamath](https://metamath.org) its verification system, and can be transpiled to (i.e. they can be verified with) and from (to a smaller extent) metamath. It extends metamath in providing program modularization, so that large source files can be broken into smaller ones. It borrows from [Isabelle's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabelle_(proof_assistant)) its familiar syntax.

Here is an example of a a typogram that verifies the first theorem of Hofstader's PQ system:

```
// "-" is a wff (well-formed formula)
axiom w0() {
  return wff -;
}

// if x is a wff, then "w -" is a wff
axiom w1(wff x) {
  return wff x -;
}

// "- -" is a wff
theorem t0() {
  do {
    w0;	w1;
  };
  return wff - -;
}
```
