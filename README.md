Typogram (short for typographic programs) is a programming language that only operates with mechanical typographic transformations. It is intended to be used to represent verifiable derivations in axiomatic systems (e.g. mathematical derivations). 

Typogram borrows from [metamath](https://metamath.org) its verification system, and can be transpiled to (i.e. they can be verified with) and from (to a smaller extent) metamath. It extends metamath in providing program modularization, so that large source files can be broken into smaller ones. It borrows from [Isabelle's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabelle_(proof_assistant)) its familiar syntax.

Here are a few examples of Typograms running in browsers:
